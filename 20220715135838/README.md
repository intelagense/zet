# The Missinformation Age

In the time leading into the early years of the information age we had access to bad information that was still somewhat useful in a heuristic sense. 

I refer to this new era as *The Missinformation Age.* We are in a battle between fact-checking and fact-burying. Hiding information from the public leads people to be trapped inside the walled cities of censored search results.
