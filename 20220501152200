# An actual  place for everything not just everything in a place

If you run out of room in a bookshelf don't let your friends come over and help you organize by just shoving the books in the shelf like tetris pieces. 
(front to back, stacked on top of eachother, perpendicular to each other.)
This applies to anything you need to organize for yourself or for others.
