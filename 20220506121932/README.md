# Brainstorming and coming up with ideas

## Dumb ideas are some of the best ideas

> "Nevermind it's a dumb idea"

You *have* to let your mind wander to the extremes when brainstorming. 
It is supposed to be a **brainstorm** not just a **slight chance of brain.**
Go far enough with it and at some point you will have passed by a real solution (or several solutions.)

## Don't dismiss your success as a failure

Have you ever "invented something" and were dissapointed when you found out it already exists? 
Are you telling me that you just came up with a viable idea and now you are *discouraged?*
I would say you are already on the right track to come up with the "next big thing."

## Far-fetched ideas?

Even some of the of the crazier ideas you come up with will already exist.
* Self digging shovel (Air spade)
* Water bowl that keeps the dog's ears dry (Slopper Stopper)
* Car that can drive sideways (Nissan Pivo Concept)
